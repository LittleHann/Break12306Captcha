This project is the implementation of _Discovering Sematic Meaning with Unsupervised Learning_. The task is to recognize the captcha from [China Railway Official Website](http://www.12306.cn). 



With the image-image and image-label co-occurrence information, we construct a graph, and run label propagation on it to link codes and images.
