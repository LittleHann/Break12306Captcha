1. The probability of some image belonging to certain categories are around 0.1, we don't have too much confidence in this range. (some which are slightly greater that 0.1 are negative but some which are slightly smaller that 0.1 are positive (like 0.08, 0.06) ).
2. Some images are too rare that we don't have enough information about it. (0, 0.01, 0.02).
3. 0.1 was set heuristically, probably there is a better one.
